### ⬦ Update CFW
Download the most popular Switch CFWs. After downloading the CFW archive, the program will ask you whether you want to override your existing .ini files.

### ⬦ Update Sigpatches

### ⬦ Download cheats
Downloads and extracts daily-updated cheat code. The program will only extract cheat codes for the games you own. By default, this homebrew will overwrite the existing cheats.
